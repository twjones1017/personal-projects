# personal-projects

This repo was created to do the MS3 coding challenge specifically. It should not house any other work on any other projects
save for the project. The project was to create a java program to import a CSV file into an SQL database, and write 
specified information to special .csv or.log files.

The project is not working at the moment of the creation of this ReadMe. I have been very busy with moving, family matters,
and will be going out of town very soon, so I have not had as much time to work on this as I would have liked. I tried,
however, to set up a skeleton that I can expand upon to eventually get working when I have more time when I get back
next week.

So my first choice was to create a buffered reader to read the .csv file into the program to be evaluated, and then after
the program was pulled in to split it up by commas. I created a new object to store the information for the database,
then assigned each aspect of the database to some position in the object array. I also used an online resource to 
figure out how to pull the CSV file into the database since all I have done to this point is evaluation of .txt files. It 
has been challenging figuring out how to pull the data in from a new type of file, but I have enjoyed doing this up to 
this point. I would love to work on this more and get this working after I get back from being away. I tried to not make
this too complicated that someone looking at it for the first time could understand right away what I wanted to do. I have
not commented the code due to lack of time, as well. Sorry about that.
